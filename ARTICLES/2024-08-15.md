cf. File reactos/win32ss/user/ntuser/keyboard.c, Function ProcessKeyEvent.

This function generates keyboard event. The keyboard events are WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP, WM_SYSKEYDOWN, and WM_SYSKEYUP messages.

cf. File reactos/win32ss/user/ntuser/msgqueue.c, Function co_IntProcessKeyboardMessage.

This function processes keyboard messages in message queue.
And then it calls IntImmProcessKey function.

cf. File reactos/win32ss/user/ntuser/ime.c, Function IntImmProcessKey.

This function is a gate way to imm32!ImmProcessKey.

Line 601. IntCheckImeHotKey checks IME hotkeys.

Line 628. Unless IMM mode, the function fails.

Line 631. If INVALID_HOTKEY, then normal key processing.

Line 661. WM_SYSKEYDOWN and WM_SYSKEYUP are being ignored unless VK_MENU and VK_F10.

IntImmProcessKey calls co_ImmProcessKey. co_ImmProcessKey just invokes imm32!ImmProcessKey  from subsystem.

cf. File reactos/dll/win32/imm32/keymsg.c, Function ImmProcessKey.

If the event is IME hot-key, then dwHotKeyID should not INVALID_HOTKEY.

Line 771. the function calls Imm32ProcessHotKey if the event is IME hotkey.

Line 251. Function Imm32ProcessHotKey. If the IME is Japanaese, the IME hot-key is IME_JHOTKEY_CLOSE_OPEN and it invokes Imm32JCloseOpen.

Line 161. Function Imm32JCloseOpen. This function should open or close the Japanese IME.

imm32!ImmSetOpenStatus or imm32!Imm32ImeNonImeToggle will do it.

Be careful. ReactOS contains some bugs or mistakes. So, my explanation above can be wrong.
