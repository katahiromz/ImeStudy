Generally, the IME installer calls `ImmInstallIME` function.

This function invokes IME's `ImeInquire` function. The IME file is a DLL file with `.ime` extension with specific version info.

The IME file will be deployed in system32 by that function or installer.

`ImmInstallIME` writes IME registry info. The registry info will be loaded in loading IME into IMM.

There are two types of KL. IME KL and non-IME KL.

There is a problem in processing IME Hot-key in ReactOS. `VK_KANJI` (`[半/全]`) key won't work.
